Turn 1:
* If all of pile’s cards are flipped over twice with no cards moved:
   * Game over;
* Deal the cards;
* Look over all the cards on the field; 
   * if there are any aces: 
      * Move to the delegated pile on the side and look at flipped over cards;
      * Check if any face up in the piles can be put on top of aces in sequential ascending order that also has the same suite:
         * If yes, move;
* Check if you can move cards between piles (moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then black):
   * If can, move any available cards from one pile to another;
   * If there is a card under the card you move:
      * Flip over the new card and see if any moves may be made to piles (same rules apply);
* Check again if any cards can be put on top of the foundations in sequential order with same suite or aces can start a foundation:
   * If true, move to foundations;
   * Else, next step;
* Check if you have any kings face up:
   * If open pile = true, move to open pile; 
      * If move was from a pile:
         * Flip over the card that was below the king;
         * Repeat all previous processes;
* If preceding moves can be repeated:
   * Continue to move until no more moves are possible;
* Flip over 3 cards from the top of the deck one at a time if there are less than 3 cards, deal as many as you can;
* Look at the top card;
   * Check if the first card can be put on top of a foundation or start a foundation with an ace (Must be sequential and same suite):
      * If true, move;
   * Check if card can be moved to a pile:
      * Moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then black);
      * If moved, check if the second card flipped over can be moved;
      * Check for possible repeated moves;
   * If not, check if first card is a king:
      * If king, check if you can place it on an open pile:
      * If open pile = true, move it there;
      * Else, skip;
      * Check for possible repeated moves;
   * If first card is moved, check second face-up card:
      * Repeat previous process;
      * If second card is moved=true:
         * Check if third card can be moved:
            * If true, repeat;
* If there are leftover cards (i.e. first flipped, second, or third flipped weren’t moved ):
   * Place them to the bottom of the deck;
* Check if you can move cards between piles (moving to pile must be in descending order and must be alternating in color (i.e. black then red/red then black):
   * If can, move any available cards from one pile to another;
   * If there is a card under the card you move:
      * Flip over the new card and see if any moves may be made to piles (same rules apply);
* Check again if any cards can be put on top of the foundations in sequential order with same suite or aces can start a foundation:
   * If true, move to foundations;
   * Else, next step;
* Check if you have any kings face up:
   * If open pile = true, move to open pile; 
      * If move was from a pile:
         * Flip over the card that was below the king;
         * Repeat all previous processes;
* If preceding moves can be repeated:
   * Continue to move until no more moves are possible;
* When complete, turn over;
Turn 2: Repeat Turn 1 process;
Turn 3: Repeat Turn 1 process;
